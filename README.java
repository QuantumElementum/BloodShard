Description of the future game: 
BloodShard is a retro first-person shooter with a mix of skill-based gameplay and carnage inspired by the best shooters of the 90s and of course Ultrakill. Take down your enemies piece by piece with a variety of devastating weapons and go through the adventure alone or not.

Development has been going on for a week now and is progressing every day.

To run the game you must have Java JDK 23 or higher.
